<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Mokoto Molokwane, a passionate HTML web developer with over one years
  of experience in creating responsive and user-friendly websites. I specialize
  in HTML, and would like to learn CSS, and JavaScript, and have a keen eye for
  detail and design.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my career, I've worked on various projects, from small business
  websites to large e-commerce platforms. My goal is to build websites that not
  only look great but also provide an excellent user experience.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not coding, you can find me at the local gym or playing tennis at the
  local club. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
